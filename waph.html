        <h3>Web Application Programming and Hacking Course Information</h3>

        <p>This course studies the basic web application development with front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and
            back-end (PHP/MySQL). In addition, the course introduces Web application vulnerabilities and attacks with
            hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid
            potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>

        <p>This course includes Hands-on Labs through Hackathons</p>
        <h3>Overview of Lab 0</h3>
        <p>This Lab is completed in two parts. In the Part 1 of this lab, Configuration an
            Ubuntu virtual machine. I proceeded to install essential software components including net-tools, Sublime
            Text, Git, Pandoc, Apache 2, Google Chrome, and Wireshark to establish the lab environment. In Part 2, I
            cloned the course repository from GitHub to my local machine. Additionally, I generated an SSH key pair,
            enabling me to clone my private repository to the local machine without the need for user credentials. This
            facilitates seamless Git actions in the repository.</p>
        <h3>Overview of Lab 1</h3>
        <p>This lab is covered in Lecture 3 with the following tasks.
            Part I: The Web and HTTP Protocol
            Task 1 (10 pts). Familiar with the Wireshark tool and HTTP protocol
            Task 2 (10 pts). Understanding HTTP using telnet and Wireshark.
            Part II: Basic Web Application Programming
            Task 1 (10 pts). CGI Web applications in C
            Task 2 (10 pts). A simple PHP Web Application with user input.
            Task 3 (10 pts). Understanding HTTP GET and POST requests </p>
        <h3>Overview of Lab 2</h3>
        <p>This Lab is divided into 2 tasks. The part 1 of the lab is to create basic HTML Page with including forms and
            Java Script. While Task 2 involves Ajax, CSS, jQuery and Web API Integration. I have followed the steps
            given in the lecture slides and watched the class recordings to get to know about the lab tasks and have
            done this lab in Virtual Machine with the help of Sublime Text Editor.</p>
        <h3>Overview of Hackathon 1</h3>
        <p>This hackathon consists of multiple hands-on exercises covered in Lectures 7-8, where I would perform
            cross-site scripting attacks on multiple levels to understand the vulnerabilities as well as defense
            methods. I followed the instructions to do the lecture exercises to complete this hacking exercise.</p>
        <h3>Overview of Individual Project</h3>
        <p>This Individual project is to develop a portfolio for myself and to showcase my skills in order to target my
            potential employer. This has been pushed into a public repository. Additionally, apart from the contents of
            my resume, there were additional tasks given by professor that were already covered in previous labs. </p>
